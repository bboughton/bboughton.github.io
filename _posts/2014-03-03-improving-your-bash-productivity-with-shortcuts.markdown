title: Improving your bash productivity with shortcuts
---

I love finding new shortcuts that help me make my everyday activities faster.
This last week I discovered the bash shortcut __ctrl + d__ which exits the
current shell, equivalent to typing `exit`. On any given day I am in and out of
multiple shells including bash, gitsh, and irb. Using __ctrl + d__ to quickly
exit and continue on my way has been such a delight.

In addition to __ctrl + d__ I use the following shortcuts quite often in my
daily work;

 *  __ctrl + c__ terminate the current process
 *  __ctrl + z__ suspend the current process
 *  __ctrl + u__ undo a line
 *  __ctrl + p__ move up the history stack
 *  __ctrl + n__ move down the history stack
 *  __ctrl + r__ allow searching of the command history
 *  __ctrl + l__ clear the screen
