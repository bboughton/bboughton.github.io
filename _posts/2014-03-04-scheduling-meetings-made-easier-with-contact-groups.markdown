title: Scheduling meetings made easier with contact groups
---

When scheduling a meeting in a company that has many meeting rooms to choose
from, it can be difficult and time consuming to find a room that is available
when all of your attendees are also available. You have to add each room to the
meeting invitation and check its availability. On a busy meeting day, you can go
through the entire list of meeting rooms, if you can even remember the names of
those rooms.

Contact groups to the rescue!

Create a contact group containing all of the rooms you would potentially hold
meetings in. I named my contact group "Meeting Rooms".

![Create Group][create-group]

Now when creating a meeting invitation, add your new contact group ("Meeting
Rooms") which will add all the rooms to your invitation.

![Invite Group][invite-group]

Of the rooms available, decide which room will work (considering capacity,
location, equiptment, etc.) and delete the rest of the rooms before you send the
invitation.

![Check Availablity][check-availability]

Using contact groups will allow you to spend less time creating your next
meeting.
