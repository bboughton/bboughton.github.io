title: "OSX Paste with Style"

Don't you hate it when you copy some text from the Internet and paste it into an
email and it looks just as it did on the web page, messing up your email?

_The background color, bolded text, hyperlink, and font are all pasted into your
email._

The common solution to this problem is to open up an application that doesn't
support styles, like VIM or the url bar in your favorite web browser. Paste the
copied text into this application and re-copy it style-free. Now you can paste
this text into your email and you are on your way.

This is a painful process that can eat up hours of your life. However, there is
a little known shortcut that OSX provides to make this a no brainer. **Command -
Shift - Option - V** will “apply the style of the surrounding text to the
inserted object”. Simply put, utilizing this shortcut will allow you to paste
your content while matching the style of the document you are pasting into. 

_Only the text has been pasted._
